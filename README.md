# Spotify-Restart-on-Ad
This program restarts and triggers the systemwide play-pause button in the event of an advertisement on Spotify.
The aim is to create as close to an Anti-Advert Spotify as possible

### 1. Run `Implant and Run.pyw` to "implant" the main file (`spotify restart.pyw`) in the startup directory so that it activates everytime on system boot.
### 2. Either restart your system now or run `spotify restart.pyw`
### 3. Enjoy an Anti-Ad experience on non-pro Spotify!
#### The application makes two short beeps [a high and a low] indicating that it has started and is ready for action all day long!

##### Two known bugs still exists, which may possibly crash this anti-ad program or let some specific ads skip through. In case this happens, restart `spotify restart.pyw` and wait for the beeps again.
if Spotify restarts, well and good, if not, then the ad has successfully escaped detection and will continue to do so. So you may need to restart using the second program "manual spotify restart.pyw".
